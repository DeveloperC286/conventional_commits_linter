Feature: When the commit title exceeds the configured maximum length, it is picked up as a linting violation.


  Scenario Outline: Long commit title fails with default limit then passes with increased limit.
    Given the context and environment are reset.
    When linting the "<commit_message>".
    And the argument --output is set as "JSON".
    Then a commit title too long violation is detected.
    When the argument --max-commit-title-length is set to "100".
    Then the linting passes.

    Examples:
      | commit_message                                                    |
      | "feat: this is a very long commit message that definitely exceeds seventy-two characters\n" |


  Scenario Outline: Long commit title fails with default limit then passes when length checking is disabled.
    Given the context and environment are reset.
    When linting the "<commit_message>".
    And the argument --output is set as "JSON".
    Then a commit title too long violation is detected.
    When the argument --max-commit-title-length is set to "0".
    Then the linting passes.

    Examples:
      | commit_message                                                    |
      | "feat: this is a very long commit message that definitely exceeds seventy-two characters\n" |


  Scenario Outline: Short commit title passes with default limit then fails with decreased limit.
    Given the context and environment are reset.
    When linting the "<commit_message>".
    Then the linting passes.
    When the argument --max-commit-title-length is set to "15".
    And the argument --output is set as "JSON".
    Then a commit title too long violation is detected.

    Examples:
      | commit_message        |
      | "feat: add new feature" |
