Feature: When the commit title has no space after the colon preceding the Conventional Commits type and scope, it is picked up as a Conventional Commits specification violation.


  Scenario Outline:
    Given the context and environment are reset.
    When the flag --from-stdin is set and the standard input is "<standard_input>".
    And the argument --output is set as "JSON".
    Then has no space after the colon preceding the type and scope violation is detected.
