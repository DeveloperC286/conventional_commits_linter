Feature: No space after the colon preceding the type and scope is picked up as a Conventional Commits specification violation.


  Scenario Outline:
    Given the context and environment are reset.
    When the standard input is "<standard_input>".
    Then the linting fails.
    And a no space after the colon preceding the type and scope violation is detected.


    Examples:
      | standard_input                                                                                  |
